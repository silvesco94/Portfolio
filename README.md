## Projects Overview

### [Capstone Projects](https://silvesco94.github.io/Swire-Cola-Capstone-/)
- **Predictive Maintenance Model for Swire Coca-Cola**: Developed a solution to minimize unplanned machine downtimes by forecasting machinery failures using survival analysis and machine learning models.
  - **Business Problem**: Addressed production shortfalls and estimated $60 million annual losses due to unplanned equipment breakdowns.
  - **Solution Approach**:
    - *Survival Analysis*: Estimated the likelihood of machine failures over time to predict high-risk periods.
    - *Random Forest Models*: Identified key features influencing breakdowns, providing accurate predictions.
    - *Logistic Regression*: Predicted probabilities of equipment failure under specific conditions.
  - **Business Value**:
    - *Proactive Maintenance Planning*: Reduced unplanned downtimes by identifying high-risk machinery, improving repair efficiency and resource allocation.
    - *Operational Efficiency*: Enhanced production continuity, meeting customer demands through consistent schedules.
    - *Cost Savings*: Aimed to cut downtime-related losses by at least 50%, potentially saving millions annually.
  - **Challenges Overcome**:
    - Managed over 80% missing equipment IDs, reducing model granularity at the machine level.
    - Handled imbalanced breakdown data to avoid overfitting.
    - Addressed inconsistent date fields through extensive preprocessing for accurate analysis.

### [Data Engineering](https://silvesco94.github.io/Data-Engineering/)
- **Baseball Stats Pipeline**:
  - Automated data collection using the Pybaseball package and APIs like Fangraphs and MLB.
  - Designed a relational database schema (3NF) and used GCP for scalable storage.
  - Built Airflow workflows for automated data ingestion and updates.

- **ETL Pipeline**:
  - Extracted, transformed, and loaded data into structured formats using Python and SQL.
  - Standardized data to ensure compatibility with the database schema.

- **Challenges and Future Plans**:
  - Resolved inconsistent player IDs across sources and refined schema design.
  - Plan to integrate additional datasets and optimize querying with advanced storage solutions.
